My name's Pranav. I like hiking, baking, roads, networks, public transport, cooking, country music, basketball, history, and factories. And probably other stuff too. I am currently working at the National Institutes of Health, using three-dimensional electron microscopy to look at developing cells.

You can see things I've made here, my occasional thoughts, as well as links to the rest of my online presence.
