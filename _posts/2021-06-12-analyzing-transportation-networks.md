Recently, I found [this great course](https://sboyles.github.io/teaching/ce392c/index.html) on transportation network analysis. It is totally free, as is the accompanying textbook! So, I worked my way through the homeworks, and really learned a lot about the fundamentals of transportation network analysis. Since my most recent obsession is Observable notebooks, I wanted to make a notebook with some visualizations of the concepts I had learned, applied to real-life dataset.


You can check out my [notebook on transportation network analysis on Observable](https://www.observablehq.com/@pgi/transpo-net).
